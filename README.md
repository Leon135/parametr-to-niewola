## Description

This is a passionate (and satirical) project counting down to the moment of truth: the extended mathematics matura exam. The title references the infamous "parameter" problems that plague Polish high school students - hence "PARAMETR TO NIEWOLA" (Parameter is Slavery).

**Disclaimer:** This is purely for entertainment purposes. I do NOT actually promote rebellion against CKE. (Even though they deserve it.)

The project attempts to capture the atmosphere of dystopian surveillance while also serving as motivation to finally finish those nightmare equations.
